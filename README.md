# Flowmodoro

A productivity timer based on the Flowmodoro method, designed with cognitive psychology principles to maximize flow state and minimize anxiety.

## Description and Purpose

Flowmodoro is a web application that implements the Flowmodoro productivity method, a variant of the traditional Pomodoro technique that respects your natural work rhythm. Unlike Pomodoro which forces you to work in fixed 25-minute blocks, Flowmodoro allows you to work until you naturally need a break, rewarding you with proportional rest time based on your effort.

### Why Flowmodoro?

- **Respects your Flow**: Does not interrupt your concentration with arbitrary alarms
- **Rewards Effort**: The more you work, the more rest you earn (5:1 ratio)
- **Reduces Anxiety**: Minimalist design hides seconds to avoid time obsession
- **Encourages Honesty**: The registration system makes you aware of your real productivity
